# Magic Games Engineering Case

You are going to implement basic mechanics of a simple match-3 game.
You are given a two dimensional board that contains different colored items.
Each integer represents a color in board grid.

You are given some test cases on file "Assets/Scripts/Tests/TestRunner.cs". We are expecting these tests 
to pass without any issue. You can run the given tests using Unity Test Runner where you 
can open its window on "Window > General > Test Runner".

You can find all the remaining instructions in the file "Assets/Scripts/InterviewCase.cs" and 
you should only edit this file on the version you send to us.

Note that for the sake of simplicity in this case, you will be finding linear matches instead of more complex shapes 
like those in standard match-3 games. However, it is essential to keep in mind that your solution must be robust and 
extendable to support future shape additions.

Also, performance is an important factor to consider besides test cases, so try to be as efficient as possible
when writing your solutions.

Good luck!
